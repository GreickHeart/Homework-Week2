# Homework-Week2
This is the repository containing all necessary files for the Week 2 Homework assignment- "Responsive Portfolio"

I have used placeholder images in the portfolio section, and have provided links to some of my social media in the contact page. The input options for messaging do not function, though I felt that was uneccesary for the assignment's completion.

Upon realizing that it is possible to add a link in the navbar's title, I could not help but add in a little something extra for fun. If I should reduce the amount of extra files in my assigments or resist putting in little details like the secret.html file please let me know.

This was a far more challenging assignment than Week 1's homework, however creating our own code from scratch (with the exclusion of bootstrap elements of course) was exciting. I can already tell that I am improving.
