     <div class=col-sm-4> <h4> I have had an interest in technology since I was young, and now I am pursuing a career in it. I have taken four programming courses before this, and each subsequent class has shown me how much I have left to learn. This course has been no exception. I hope to rise to the expectation set for us all, and ensure that this investment in my life and future is well worth it. Thank you for reading, and feel free to jump around my portfolio. It may be simple, but there will be updates coming as I learn! </h4> </div>
